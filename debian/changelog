libimxvpuapi (0.10.3) stable; urgency=low

  * properly pass on color format in simplified JPEG encoder interface
  * add alternative write-callback-style encoding mode
    also add encode example variant which uses write-callback style output
  * add support for "fake grayscale mode" in encoders
    this is done by using I420 internally and filling the U and V planes
    with 0x80 bytes
  * make sure JPEG quantization table is copied in standardized zig zag order
    the VPU does not, so this has to be done explicitely

libimxvpuapi (0.10.2) stable; urgency=low

  * Fix AUD NAL positioning in h.264 encoder output
    (SPS/PPS/AUD were ordered incorrectly - AUD has to come first, not last)
  * Fix build error with examples when --enable-static is used
  * Pass quality factor in simplified JPEG encoder interface correctly
  * Add functions for querying and setting header data
    useful for modifying headers, like VUI data in the SPS RBSP
  * Documentation updates
