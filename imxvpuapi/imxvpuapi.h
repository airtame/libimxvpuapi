/* ImxVpuDMABufferAllocator:
 *
 * This structure contains function pointers (referred to as "vfuncs") which define an allocator for
 * DMA buffers (= physically contiguous memory blocks). It is possible to define a custom allocator,
 * which is useful for tracing memory allocations, and for hooking up any existing allocation mechanisms,
 * such as ION or CMA.
 *
 * Older allocators like the VPU ones unfortunately work with physical addresses directly, and do not support
 * DMA-BUF or the like. To keep compatible with these older allocators and allowing for newer and better
 * methods, both physical addresses and FDs are supported by this API. Typically, an allocator allows for
 * one of them. If an allocator does not support FDs, @get_fd must return -1. If it does not support physical
 * addresses, then the physical address returned by @get_physical_address must be set to zero.
 *
 * The vfuncs are:
 *
 * @allocate: Allocates a DMA buffer. "size" is the size of the buffer in bytes. "alignment" is the address
 *            alignment in bytes. An alignment of 1 or 0 means that no alignment is required.
 *            "flags" is a bitwise OR combination of flags (or 0 if no flags are used, in which case
 *            cached pages are used by default).
 *            If allocation fails, NULL is returned.
 *
 * @deallocate: Deallocates a DMA buffer. The buffer must have been allocated with the same allocator.
 *
 * @map: Maps a DMA buffer to the local address space, and returns the virtual address to this space.
 *       "flags" is a bitwise OR combination of flags (or 0 if no flags are used, in which case it will map
 *       in regular read/write mode).
 *
 * @unmap: Unmaps a DMA buffer. @map and @unmap must contain an internal counter, to allow for multiple
 *       map/unmap calls. Only if that counter reaches zero again - in other words, once @unmap is called as
 *       many times as @map was called - unmapping shall actually occur.
 *
 * @get_fd: Gets the file descriptor associated with the DMA buffer. This is the preferred way of interacting
 *          with DMA buffers. If the underlying allocator does not support FDs, this function returns -1.
 *
 * @get_physical_address: Gets the physical address associated with the DMA buffer. This address points to the
 *                        start of the buffer in the physical address space. If no physical addresses are
 *                        supported by the allocator, this function returns 0.
 *
 * @get_size: Returns the size of the buffer, in bytes.
 *
 * The vfuncs @get_fd, @get_physical_address, and @get_size can also be used while the buffer is mapped. */

/************************************************/
/******* DECODER STRUCTURES AND FUNCTIONS *******/
/************************************************/


/* How to use the decoder (error handling omitted for clarity):
 * 1. Call imx_vpu_dec_load()
 * 2. Call imx_vpu_dec_get_bitstream_buffer_info(), and allocate a DMA buffer
 *    with the given size and alignment. This is the minimum required size.
 *    The buffer can be larger, but must not be smaller than the given size.
 * 3. Fill an instance of ImxVpuDecOpenParams with the values specific to the
 *    input data. In most cases, one wants to set enable_frame_reordering to 1
 *    with h.264 data here. Width & height can be zero for formats which carry size
 *    information inside their bitstreams and/or out-of-band codec data.
 * 4. Call imx_vpu_dec_open(), passing in a pointer to the filled ImxVpuDecOpenParams
 *    instance, the DMA buffer of the bitstream DMA buffer which was allocated in step 2,
 *    a callback of type imx_vpu_dec_new_initial_info_callback, and a user defined pointer
 *    that is passed to the callback (if not needed, just set it to NULL).
 * 5. Call imx_vpu_dec_decode(), and push data to it. Once initial information about the
 *    bitstream becomes available, the callback from step 4 is invoked.
 * 6. Inside the callback, the new initial info is available. The new_initial_info pointer
 *    is never NULL. In this callback, framebuffers are allocated and registered, as
 *    explained in the next steps. Steps 7-9 are performed inside the callback.
 * 7. (Optional) Perform the necessary size and alignment calculations by calling
 *    imx_vpu_calc_framebuffer_sizes(). Pass in either the frame width & height from
 *    ImxVpuDecInitialInfo , or some explicit values that were determined externally.
 * 8. Create an array of at least as many ImxVpuFramebuffer instances as specified in
 *    min_num_required_framebuffers. Each instance must point to a DMA buffer that is big
 *    enough to hold a frame. If step 7 was performed, allocating as many bytes as indicated
 *    by total_size is enough. Make sure the Y,Cb,Cr,MvCol offsets in each ImxVpuFramebuffer
 *    instance are valid. Using the imx_vpu_fill_framebuffer_params() convenience function
 *    for this is recommended.
 * 9. Call imx_vpu_dec_register_framebuffers() and pass in the ImxVpuFramebuffer array
 *    and the number of ImxVpuFramebuffer instances.
 *    This should be the last action in the callback.
 * 10. Continue calling imx_vpu_dec_decode(). The virtual address in encoded_frame
 *     must not be NULL.
 *     If the IMX_VPU_DEC_OUTPUT_CODE_DECODED_PICTURE_AVAILABLE flag is set in the output code,
 *     call imx_vpu_dec_get_decoded_picture() with a pointer to an ImxVpuPicture instance
 *     which gets filled with information about the decoded picture. Once the decoded picture
 *     has been processed by the user, imx_vpu_dec_mark_framebuffer_as_displayed() must be
 *     called to let the decoder know that the framebuffer is available for storing new
 *     decoded pictures again.
 *     If IMX_VPU_DEC_OUTPUT_CODE_DROPPED is set, you can call
 *     imx_vpu_dec_get_dropped_frame_context() to retrieve the context field
 *     of the dropped frame. If IMX_VPU_DEC_OUTPUT_CODE_EOS is set, stop playback and close
 *     the decoder.
 * 11. In case a flush/reset is desired (typically after seeking), call imx_vpu_dec_flush().
 *     Note that any internal context pointers from the en/decoded frames will be
 *     set to NULL after this call (this is the only exception where the library modifies
 *     the context fields).
 * 12. When there is no more incoming data, and pending decoded frames need to be retrieved
 *     from the decoder, enable drain mode with imx_vpu_dec_enable_drain_mode(). This is
 *     typically necessary when the data source reached its end, playback is finishing, and
 *     there is a delay of N frames at the beginning.
 *     After this call, continue calling imx_vpu_dec_decode() to retrieve the pending
 *     decoded pictures, but the virtual address of encoded_frame and the codec data pointer
 *     must be NULL.
 *     As in step 10, if IMX_VPU_DEC_OUTPUT_CODE_EOS is set, stop playback, close the decoder.
 * 13. After playback is finished, close the decoder with imx_vpu_dec_close().
 * 14. Deallocate framebuffer memory blocks and the bitstream buffer memory block.
 * 15. Call imx_vpu_dec_unload().
 *
 * Step 15 should only be called if no more playback sessions will occur.
 *
 * In situations where decoding and display of decoded frames happen in different threads, it
 * is necessary to wait until decoding is possible. imx_vpu_dec_check_if_can_decode() is used
 * for this purpose. This needs to be done in steps 5 and 10. Example pseudo code:
 *
 *   mutex_lock(&mutex);
 *
 *   while (!imx_vpu_dec_check_if_can_decode(decode))
 *     condition_wait(&condition_variable, &mutex);
 *
 *   imx_vpu_dec_decode_frame(decoder, encoded_frame, &output_code);
 *   ...
 *
 *   mutex_unlock(&mutex);

/******* ENCODER STRUCTURES AND FUNCTIONS *******/
/************************************************/


/* How to use the encoder (error handling omitted for clarity):
 * 1. Call imx_vpu_enc_load
 * 2. Call imx_vpu_enc_get_bitstream_buffer_info(), and allocate a DMA buffer
 *    with the given size and alignment.
 * 3. Fill an instance of ImxVpuEncOpenParams with the values specific to the
 *    input data. It is recommended to use imx_vpu_enc_set_default_open_params()
 *    and afterwards set any explicit valus.
 * 4. Call imx_vpu_enc_open(), passing in a pointer to the filled ImxVpuEncOpenParams
 *    instance, and the DMA buffer of the bitstream DMA buffer which was allocated in step 2.
 * 5. Call imx_vpu_enc_get_initial_info(). The encoder's initial info contains the
 *    minimum number of framebuffers that must be allocated and registered, and the
 *    address alignment value for these framebuffers.
 * 6. (Optional) Perform the necessary size and alignment calculations by calling
 *    imx_vpu_calc_framebuffer_sizes(). Pass in the width & height of the frames that
 *    shall be encoded.
 * 7. Create an array of at least as many ImxVpuFramebuffer instances as specified in
 *    min_num_required_framebuffers. Each instance must point to a DMA buffer that is big
 *    enough to hold a frame. If step 6 was performed, allocating as many bytes as indicated
 *    by total_size is enough. Make sure the Y,Cb,Cr,MvCol offsets in each ImxVpuFramebuffer
 *    instance are valid. Using the imx_vpu_fill_framebuffer_params() convenience function
 *    for this is recommended. Note that these framebuffers are used for temporary internal
 *    encoding only, and will not contain input or output data.
 * 8. Call imx_vpu_enc_register_framebuffers() and pass in the ImxVpuFramebuffer array
 *    and the number of ImxVpuFramebuffer instances.
 * 9. Allocate a DMA buffer for the input frames. Only one buffer is necessary. Simply
 *    reuse the sizes used for the temporary buffers in step 7.
 * 10. Allocate a DMA buffer for the encoded output data. Set its size to an appropriate value.
 *     Typically, using the same size as the input buffer is enough, since the whole point of
 *     encoding is to produce encoded frames that are much smaller than the original ones.
 *     However, if a very high bitrate is used, and the input frames are small in size, the
 *     encoded frames may be bigger. This is considered a questionable use case, though, since
 *     then there is no point in encoding.
 * 11. Create an instance of ImxVpuPicture, set its values to zero (typically by using memset()),
 *     and set its framebuffer pointer to refer to the DMA buffer allocated in step 9.
 * 12. Create an instance of ImxVpuEncodedFrame, set its values to zero (typically by using memset()),
 *     and set its data.dma_buffer pointer to refer to the DMA buffer allocated in step 10.
 * 13. Create an instance of ImxVpuEncParams, set its values to zero (typically by using memset()),
 *     and set at least its frame_width, frame_height, framerate, and quant_param values.
 *     In most cases, setting them to the same values as in the open params is enough.
 * 14. Fill the DMA buffer from step 9 with pixels from an input frame, either by transferring
 *     then over DMA somehow (through an i.MX IPU operation for example), or by mapping the buffer
 *     and filling it with pixels with the CPU. Make sure the buffer is unmapped afterwards!
 *     (See imx_vpu_dma_buffer_map() / imx_vpu_dma_buffer_unmap())
 * 15. Call imx_vpu_enc_encode(). Pass the structures from steps 11, 12 and 13 to it.
 *     If the IMX_VPU_ENC_OUTPUT_CODE_ENCODED_FRAME_AVAILABLE bit is set in the output code,
 *     it is possible to map the output DMA buffer, and access the encoded data. The data_size
 *     member in the encoded frame structure contains the actual size of the data, in bytes.
 *     If the IMX_VPU_ENC_OUTPUT_CODE_SEQUENCE_HEADER is set, sequence header data is available as
 *     well (this is h.264 specific). The encoded data is typically stored in a container format
 *     at this stage.
 * 16. Repeat step 15 until there are no more frames to encode or an error occurs.
 * 13. After encoding is finished, close the encoder with imx_vpu_enc_close().
 * 14. Deallocate framebuffer memory blocks, the input and output DMA buffer blocks, and
 *     the bitstream buffer memory block.
 * 15. Call imx_vpu_enc_unload().
 *
 * Step 15 should only be called if no more playback sessions will occur.
 *
 * Note that the encoder does not use any kind of frame reordering. h.264 data uses the
 * baseline profile. An input frame immediately results in an output frame; there is no delay.
