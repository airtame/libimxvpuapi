==== version 0.10.3 (2016-10-12) ====

* properly pass on color format in simplified JPEG encoder interface
* add alternative write-callback-style encoding mode
  also add encode example variant which uses write-callback style output
* add support for "fake grayscale mode" in encoders
  this is done by using I420 internally and filling the U and V planes
  with 0x80 bytes
* make sure JPEG quantization table is copied in standardized zig zag order
  the VPU does not, so this has to be done explicitely

==== version 0.10.2 (2016-05-01) ====

* fix AUD NAL positioning in h.264 encoder output
  (SPS/PPS/AUD were ordered incorrectly - AUD has to come first, not last)
* fix build error with examples when --enable-static is used
* pass quality factor in simplified JPEG encoder interface correctly
* add functions for querying and setting header data
  useful for modifying headers, like VUI data in the SPS RBSP
* documentation updates

==== version 0.10.1 (2015-11-30) ====

* add debian packaging files
* update waf to version 1.8.16
* add workaround in wscript to prevent stale pkg-config .pc files
* fix memory leak by adding missing IOFreeVirtMem() call in vpulib backend

==== version 0.10.0 (2015-11-02) ====
